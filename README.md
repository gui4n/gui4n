- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gui4n
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things. My hobbies consist of gaming, editing, reading and watching manga and anime, as well as coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning animation, pixel art or sprite creation and a bit of game development. I also try to learn different programming languages, but I'm more consistent in studying Python.
